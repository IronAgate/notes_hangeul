가 or 이

identifier particle

for "who" rather than "what". see 는
as in, it stresses the who, rather than the what.
introduces a subject, rather than topic or subject

if someone asked who did something, would use this to emphasize the who
is "incorrect" to use other like 는 because that isnt what they asked
^not rly incorrect, just strange. Like emphasis in engl

it identifies ths subject / is placed after subject

나 becomes 내가 when used with 가


내가 샀어 == i slept / with emphasis on you, not the sleepin

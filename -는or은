는 and 은

vowel/consonant following forms

is a particle / subject particle

the 'topic particle'

seems to specify that this is the focus & that it is?

for "what" rather than "who". see 가
as in, stresses the what, rather than the who
introduces a topic or subject, rather than just subject

often see it as 이름은 / in my name is... contexts



used instead of 가 for a "general or factual statement"

[sort of]
its like:
- An apple is red.
would be like using 는
vs
- The apple is red.
would be like using 가

only applies when speaking generally, not when speaking specifically
[i would argue this 'rule' is just an extension of earlier emphasis guidelines]
